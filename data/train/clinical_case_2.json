  "patient_information": "7-year-old female, otherwise healthy, living in Lima, Peru. No comorbidities or immunosuppression reported.",
  "chief_complaint": "Chronic skin lesion on the nose for 4 months.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The lesion appeared 4 months ago as a small nodule and slowly turned into an ulcer. It is a bit itchy but not painful. No history of trauma.",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "Lives in the Peruvian capital, Lima. Travelled to a valley on the western slopes of the Andes 6 months ago. No animal or water/food exposures reported. Vector exposure implied by endemic setting for leishmaniasis.",
  "vitals": "Afebrile; other vital signs not reported.",
  "physical_exam": "Localized ulcer on the nose with indurated borders and plaque-like infiltration of the surrounding skin, about 2cm in diameter. No palpable lymph nodes. Rest of physical examination normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Microscopic examination of scraping negative. Leishmanin skin test positive. PCR positive for Leishmania (Viannia) peruviana. No other labs reported.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis versus sporotrichosis, cutaneous tuberculosis, Balamuthia mandrillaris, common bacterial infections (partially treated), cutaneous anthrax, and tularaemia. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is most likely given the presentation and travel to endemic area. Sporotrichosis is hyperendemic in parts of the Peruvian Andes but patient did not travel there. Cutaneous tuberculosis possible due to high incidence in poor neighborhoods. Balamuthia lesions are typically plaques without ulceration. Anthrax and tularaemia less likely due to location and duration.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Scab removed revealing ulcer with cobblestone-patterned bottom and raised edges. Treatment with intravenous sodium stibogluconate (SSG, 20mg/kg/day for 20 days) and topical imiquimod every other day for 20 days. Good response after 20 days. No signs of relapse at third month follow-up. SSG has side effects including myalgia, arthralgia, loss of appetite, nausea, fever, elevated liver and pancreatic enzymes, reactivation of varicella zoster virus, and cardiotoxicity.",
  "final_diagnosis": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania (Viannia) peruviana, confirmed by positive PCR and positive leishmanin skin test. The diagnosis aligns with the painless ulcer with raised edges, negative scraping but positive PCR, and compatible travel exposure. Alternatives were ruled out by confirmatory testing and clinical pattern.",
