Right eye: fibrotic lids with loss of architecture, tightening of palpebral aperture, loss of lower lid lashes, misdirected upper lid lashes (trichiasis), severely inflamed conjunctiva with >5 follicles on eversion, scarring of upper tarsal conjunctiva, diffuse corneal opacification with central thinning and irregular surface, fibrovascular pannus on upper cornea. Left eye: swollen lids with mucus deposits, misdirected eyelashes, eversion of lower lid margin, inflamed conjunctiva with >5 follicles and scarring, focal inferocentral corneal scars with one adherent iris indicating previous perforation, thin central cornea, shallow anterior chamber, distorted pupil towards the leucoma.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": null,
  "differential_diagnosis": "Corneal and conjunctival damage from traditional eye medicine, supported by worsening after aloe vera application. Trachomatous trichiasis, fitting all clinical criteria including follicles, scarring, pannus, and trichiasis. Vitamin A deficiency, considered due to potential malnutrition in rural setting but no specific evidence like dietary history or blood retinol levels reported.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Admitted and given oral azithromycin and oral vitamin A supplements. Referred to ophthalmologist for lid surgery to address trichiasis and conjunctival flap to seal corneal defect. No further course details provided.",
  "final_diagnosis": "Bilateral trachomatous trichiasis (TT) and corneal opacity (CO) due to Chlamydia trachomatis, with a left perforating corneal ulcer, diagnosed clinically by meeting all five trachoma criteria: tarsal conjunctival follicles, scarring, limbal follicles or Herbertâ€™s pits (implied), fibrovascular pannus, and trichiasis. Exacerbated by traditional medicine use. Vitamin A deficiency and other causes ruled out by trachoma-specific features and endemic setting.",
