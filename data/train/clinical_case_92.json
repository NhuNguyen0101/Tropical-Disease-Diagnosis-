  "labs_and_diagnostics": "FBC showed thrombocytopenia of 81 x 10^9/L (reference: 150–300) and was otherwise normal. CRP 55 mg/L (reference: <5). AST 62 U/L (reference: 10–50 U/L), ALT 106 U/L (reference: 10–50). Dengue NS1 antigen test was negative. Rapid diagnostic test for malaria was negative. A thick blood film showed Plasmodium species trophozoites at a density of 920/μL. Initial thin film microscopy was inconclusive for species. Repeated malaria microscopy by a head parasitologist identified 2 parasite-infected erythrocytes with morphological characteristics compatible with Plasmodium malariae or P. knowlesi. Species-specific PCR subsequently confirmed a mono-infection with P. knowlesi.",
