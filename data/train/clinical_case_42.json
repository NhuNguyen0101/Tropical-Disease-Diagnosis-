  "labs_and_diagnostics": null,
  "differential_diagnosis": "Cutaneous larva migrans (CLM) due to zoonotic hookworms, most likely given serpiginous tracks and travel history. Larva currens from Strongyloides stercoralis less likely due to slower track progression. Gnathostoma or Fasciola species and migratory myiasis considered but less common.",

  "final_diagnosis": "Cutaneous larva migrans caused by zoonotic hookworm larvae, diagnosed clinically by characteristic serpiginous tracks and travel history to tropical beach areas. Rapid resolution with ivermectin supports the diagnosis. Strongyloides and other causes ruled out by clinical presentation and response.",
  "disease_name_short": "Cutaneous larva migrans"
