Malaria thick film: negative (three times). Blood cultures: negative. Brucella serology: negative. Hepatitis B IgM anti-HBc: negative. IgM capture ELISA for yellow fever: highly positive at 1:10000. Anti-dengue IgM: negative. Direct viral isolation in culture (blood specimen on admission): negative. Chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates compatible with ARDS. Repeat laboratory results on day 3: creatinine 6.5 mg/dL, urea 120 mg/dL, AST 100 U/L, ALT 200 U/L.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "Severe malaria, viral hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E), toxin-mediated hepatitis, leptospirosis, typhoid fever, brucellosis, severe dengue, other viral haemorrhagic fevers (especially yellow fever).",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "The patient received presumptive treatment for malaria, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and supportive care. Over the next 3 days, he developed increasing hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure, coma, and DIC with increasing spontaneous bleeding. A chest x-ray showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates compatible with ARDS. Repeat laboratory results on day 3 showed deterioration of kidney function (creatinine 6.5 mg/dL, urea 120 mg/dL) and a sudden drop in liver transaminases (AST 100 U/L, ALT 200 U/L), likely indicating acute hepatic disintegration. The patient passed away 1 day later.",
