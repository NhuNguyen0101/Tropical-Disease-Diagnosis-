  "patient_information": "A 40-year-old male farmer from the Peruvian Amazon. He was found to be HTLV-1-positive 10 years previously. A recent HIV ELISA test was negative.",
  "chief_complaint": "Chronic productive cough and chest pain, dyspnoea on exertion, and weight loss of about 20kg.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "The patient presented with a 4-month history of chronic productive cough and chest pain. Three and a half months prior, he was hospitalized at a regional hospital for similar complaints. Three sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were negative, and a chest radiograph was abnormal. He was presumptively diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and received first-line TB therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol). Despite adherence to treatment, he showed no clinical improvement and reported persistent productive cough with streaking of blood in the sputum. He denied diarrhoea, fever, or night sweats. He was then referred to Lima with a suspected diagnosis of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR TB).",
  "exposure_and_epidemiology": "Farmer from the Peruvian Amazon. Denies recent travels. TB is highly endemic in Peru. His origin from a rural area in the central Peruvian Amazon makes MDR TB less common compared to urban areas. Paracoccidioidomycosis is a systemic fungal infection endemic only to the moist tropical regions of Latin America.",
  "vitals": "Temperature 37.2°C (98.96°F), blood pressure 120/75mmHg, pulse 70bpm regular, respiratory rate 15 breaths per minute.",
  "physical_exam": "Appears fatigued and cachectic. Few cervical and retroauricular lymph nodes are palpable, which are small, mobile, soft, and non-tender. Lungs: crackles and rhonchi bilaterally. No hepatosplenomegaly. The rest of the physical examination is normal.",
  "labs_and_diagnostics": "Initial: Three sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were negative. Chest radiograph was described as abnormal (no report or film available). HTLV-1-positive (10 years prior), HIV ELISA test negative. \nUpon referral: Platelets: 1093 x 10^9/L (reference range: 150–450); the rest of the full blood count was within normal limits. Tuberculin skin test was negative. Two subsequent AFB smears were negative. Chest x-ray showed bilateral confluent reticulonodular infiltrates predominantly in the central and upper zones of both lungs, and multiple cavities in the right lung. No hilar lymphadenopathy. Sputum KOH preparation revealed characteristic large budding yeast forms of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Culture grew P. brasiliensis.",
  "differential_diagnosis": "MDR TB, histoplasmosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, co-infection of TB (non-MDR) and paracoccidioidomycosis, parasitic infections such as paragonimiasis or pulmonary hydatid cyst.",
  "management_and_clinical_course": "Initially received first-line TB therapy (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) for 3 months with no clinical improvement. After diagnosis of paracoccidioidomycosis, TB treatment was discontinued. Given extensive pulmonary lesions and HTLV-1 co-infection, the patient was started on amphotericin B followed by itraconazole.",
  "final_diagnosis": "Chronic (adult) paracoccidioidomycosis. The thrombocytosis was considered reactive to the underlying chronic infection.",
