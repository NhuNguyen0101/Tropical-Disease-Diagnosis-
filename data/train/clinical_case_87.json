  "chief_complaint": "Persisting, incapacitating polyarthralgias.",
  "history_of_present_illness": "During the second week of a 3.5-week trip to the Peruvian Amazon, the patient developed an acute febrile illness with chills, malaise, frontal headache, generalized myalgia, and a transient, non-pruritic maculopapular rash. The rash started on forearms, spread to trunk, neck, and face, then faded after 3 days. He also experienced slowly progressive debilitating polyarthralgias affecting peripheral joints with transient joint swelling, and painful cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy which lasted about 1 week. He was clinically diagnosed with dengue fever at a local hospital and treated with paracetamol. Fever and other symptoms subsided within 1 week, but polyarthralgias persisted, showing a symmetrical pattern mainly affecting small joints of hands and feet, wrists, ankles, and knees. Upon returning to Switzerland, he consulted his general practitioner for persisting polyarthralgias and joint stiffness (morning and after immobility). After two more months of un улучishing joint pains, he was referred to a rheumatologist and a tropical medicine clinic.",
