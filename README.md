Goal
This project aims to develop an AIâ€‘powered system that assists clinicians in diagnosing tropical
and infectious diseases by leveraging Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). The system would
automate diagnosis by:
- processing patient histories, symptoms, lab results, and diagnostic images,
- generating reliable diagnostic suggestions.
Data
Clinical Case Reports on tropical and infectious diseases (e.g., Filoviral Diseases like Ebola).
Each case includes:
- background and risk factors (patient history),
- symptoms and lab test results,
- diagnostic images (e.g., radiology, microscopy scans).
